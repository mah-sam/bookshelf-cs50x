# Some html code was grabbed from the official bootstrap website
# The site was made with the help of Corey Schafer's YouTube tutorials
# The books.csv file is from "https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k", thank you for the fantastic work
# Most of the images are not mine, but random images on google, i don't know the original sources
# The covers of the books are goodreads' urls
